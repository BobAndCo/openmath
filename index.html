        <h1>openmath</h1>
        <p>
            welcome to openmath a fully open source project to create a math learning resource to everyone
        </p>

        <h2>principles</h2>
        <p>
            there are already many online resources to learn math, each one having at least something that could be considered annoying
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>youtube - not suitable for offline use, contributing requires computer with video editing software</li>
            <li>wikipedia - contains extranous information, goal is for general information</li>
            <li><a href="nlab">proofwiki </a>- less of a tool to learn topics more of a proof database, mediawiki tech stack</li>
            <li><a href="statck">nlab</a> - higher level mathematics less accessible for beginners, mediawiki</li>
            <li>brilliant - nice entry for beginners lacks cumulative content, payment required</li>
            <li>textbooks - most of them are freely accessible online, but are not easy to navigate (index to page number workflow)</li>
            <li><a href="https://math.libretexts.org/">libretexts</a> - quite useful, users cannot easily contribute, complex tech stack</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            what openmath tries to do is as follows
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>focus on learning topics in mathematics</li>
            <li>suitable for offline use</li>
            <li>contains concise mathematical information</li>
            <li>simple tech stack, no database</li>
            <li>accessible for all skill levels</li>
            <li>easy to navigate</li>
            <li>freely accessible</li>
            <li>any user can contribute</li>
            <li>write explanatory proofs</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    when reading a proof you may be able to understand that it's true by following along, then a second analysis is required to figure out how they have come up with the proof, we will try to write explanatory proofs which do both at the same time.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            additionally it focuses on <i>recursive learning</i>, which is that given a statement for each definition in that statement you can follow it back to a previous definition recursively until you're at some fundamental definition and then work your way back to the original statemen. openmath attempts to make <i>recursive learning</i> as smooth as possible
