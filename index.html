                    welcome to openmath, a fully open source project to create a math learning resource to everyone
                </p>
            </div>


            <h2>principles</h2>
            <p>
                there are already many online resources to learn math, each one specializes in something different yielding pros and cons.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>youtube - not suitable for offline use, contributing requires computer with video editing software</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikipedia </a> contains extraneous information their goal is for general information, not necessarily mathematical information</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Main_Page">wikibooks</a> contains few complete books, haven't seen active development in a while for mathematical topics, goal is creating books, needs a working knowledge of mediawiki to contribute</li>
                <li><a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Portal:Mathematics">wikiversity</a>same as above</li>
                <li><a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page">proofwiki</a> less of a tool to learn topics more of a proof database, relies on mediawiki tech stack</li>
                <li><a href="statck">nlab</a> higher level mathematics less accessible for beginners, mediawiki</li>
                <li>brilliant nice entry for beginners lacks cumulative content, payment required</li>
                <li>textbooks most of them are freely accessible online, but are not easy to navigate (index to page number workflow)  and are closed for further development</li>
                <li><a href="https://math.libretexts.org/">libretexts</a> - quite useful, users cannot easily contribute, complex tech stack</li>
                <li><a href="https://proofwiki.org/">proof wiki</a> great site, doesn't focus on the learning aspect just presents proofs, uses recursive learning, but bound within mediawiki's technologies, no external community platform</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                what openmath tries to do is as follows
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>focus on learning topics in mathematics</li>
                <li>suitable for offline use</li>
                <li>contains concise mathematical information</li>
                <li>simple tech stack (minimal possible dependencies)</li>
                <li>accessible for all skill levels</li>
                <li>easy to navigate</li>
                <li>freely accessible</li>
                <li>any user can contribute</li>
                <li>write explanatory proofs</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        when reading a proof you may be able to understand that it's true by following along, then a second analysis is required to figure out how they have come up with the proof, we will try to write explanatory proofs which do both at the same time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>keep proofs short containing at most 7 ideas</summary>
                        <p>
                            it has been shown that our short term memory can on average hold up to 7 items, when writing functions in programming it's useful to write every function in 7 lines so that you can remember every step that your function is doing, then you give it a name which reflects these steps.
                        </p>
                    </details>

                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                additionally it focuses on <i>recursive learning</i>, which is that given a statement for each definition in that statement you can follow it back to a previous definition recursively until you're at some fundamental definition and then work your way back to the original statement. openmath attempts to make <i>recursive learning</i> as smooth as possible
            </p>

            <p>
                the goal of openmath is not to have a final "edition" done and completed you can imagine it as moving through states where in each state it moves more and more towards being "complete", but is still always be in a continuous state of development, we strive to make sure that at any point openmath is usable for others.
            </p>

            <p>
                an example to help understand the above paragraph: suppose you might know something is true but don't yet have the proof, if that's the case you may enter the conjecture leave out the proof and leave a warning to other users that it hasn't been proven yet
            </p>

            <p>
                another user sees this and fills in a proof for the conjecture, now everything holds and we've moved to a more complete state, later on another user simplifies the proof moving the project more towards the complete state
            </p>

            <p>
                this process continues so that the project moves towards a more complete state
            </p>

            <p>
                another example could be a user who uploads a image of a proof they did on paper and upload it directly into a proof div, this is an improvement as now there is a proof in place of no proof, in their pull request they mention that they don't know how to use ascii math and this is the best they can do right now
            </p>

            <p>
                later on a user parses out the latex out of it and into asciimath, and another user grabs any drawings they have and paste them in as images
            </p>

            <p>
                later on another user sees the pasted images, and uses tikz to generate an svg in place (with included souce code, in case others want to modify it further)
            </p>


            <p>
                anyone can contribute to openmath, to get started make a github account and then check out the <a href="https://github.com/cuppajoeman/openmath">source code</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                only basic computer usage is required to edit the files, if you see typos or anything you'd like to change then you can edit them in the browser yourself (TODO: how)
            </p>

            <p>
                when adding theorems the ettiquette is to at a minimum add empty stubs for all of the other theorems, definitions, lemma's corollaries that it uses as dependencies and put (TODO: complete) in them. Doing this will allow other contributors to fill in details or you can come back to them later
            </p>

            <p>
                additionally you can ask questions and discuss with others using our <a href="https://github.com/cuppajoeman/openmath/discussions">github discussions</a>, the reason why we use this is that if you're contributing you already have a github account.
            </p>

            <h2>basic terminology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>definition: notation words or anything used to encapsulate something larger into something smaller</li>
                <li>theorem: something which is true, that takes more effort to show and is most likely used in many places</li>
                <li>proposition: a theorem of lesser importance</li>
                <li>lemma: a true statement which is used in proving of a theorem, and not used in many other places</li>
                <li>corollary: a true statement that doesn't take much effort to prove from a theorem or lemma</li>
                <li>exercise: something for the reader to try themselves</li>
            </ul>
