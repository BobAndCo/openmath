                    Suppose that `cc B` is a basis for the topology of `X` and `cc C` for `Y`. Then the collection `cc D = {B xx C : B in cc B text( and ) C in cc C}` then `cc D` <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-topology">is a basis for the topology</span> of `X xx Y`

				To show it's a basis we will use the <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#theorem-basis-criterion">basis criterion</span>. So let `W` be an open set of `X xx Y`, and let `(x, y) in W`, since the product topology is generated by the basis `{U xx V: X in cc T_X text( and ) Y in cc T_Y}`, then we know that by the definition of a topology generated by a basis that there is an element `U xx V` such that `(x, y) in U xx V sube W`.

			    <p>
			    Since we assumed that `cc B` and `cc C` were <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/topology/topological_spaces.html#definition-basis-for-a-topology">bases for</span> `X` and `Y` respectively then, we know that there is some element `B in cc B` such that `x in B sube U` and there is some `C in cc C` such that `y in C sube V`, thus we have found an element `B xx C in cc D` such that `(x, y) in B xx C sube U xx V = W` which proves that `cc D` is a basis and that it generates the toplogy of `X xx Y`
