                            We'd like to show that `f` is an <a href="#imbedding">imbedding</a>, that is that both `f^'` and `(f^{'})^{-1}` are both continuous functions where `f'` is `f` with it's range restricted to `f(X)`.

                        <p>
                            Starting with `f^'` and acutally looking at the original `f` we can see that it can be defined as `f(x) = (id(x), c(x))` with the identity and constant function respectively. Looking at the <a href="#rules-for-constructing-continuous-functions">rules for contructing continuous functions</a>, we can see that `id: X -> X` is simply an inclusion function from `X` into itself, and that `c: Y -> y_0` is a constant funciton, and thus are both continuous, also since <a href="#product-functions-are-continuous">product functions are continuous</a> we know that `f` is continuous, using rule 4, we can see that `f'` is also continuous.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking at `(f^')^{-1}: X xx {y_0} -> X`, we can see that this function simply drops the second component and thus `(f^')^{-1} = pi_1` and since <a href="projection-functions-are-continuous">projection functions are continuous</a>, we've shown that the inverse function is continuous.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With all that said, we now know that `f'` is a homeomorphism, which by definition means that `f` is an imbedding, which is what we needed to show.

                    Let J be an index set. Given a set X, we define a J -tuple of elements
of X to be a function x : J → X. If α is an element of J , we often denote the value
of x at α by xα rather than x(α); we call it the αth coordinate of x. And we often
denote the function x itself by the symbol
(xα)α∈J ,
which is as close as we can come to a “tuple notation” for an arbitrary index set J . We
denote the set of all J -tuples of elements of X by X J .
