		Suppose we wrote out the set `{a, b, c, d}` and then later on realized that `a = b = c = d`, then this set is simply `{a, a, a, a}`, which we define to just be `{a}`. Therefore we allow duplicates when declaring a set, but realize the set it generates has no such duplicate, so `{1, 1, 1} = {1, 1} = {1}`

                            To show that a bi-implication is true, we have to prove both directions. So first suppose that `x in A`, then since `A sube B`, `x in B`. For the other direction suppose that `x in B`, then since `B sube A` then `x in A`. Therefore we know that `x in A` if and only if `x in B` as needed.

                            We can see that `cc C = {B_a: a in A}` is a collection of subsets of `A`, so since <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/set_theory.html#proposition-union-of-subsets-is-still-a-subset">a union of a subsets is still a subset</span> we have `bigcup_{a in A} B_a sube A`.

                        <p>
                            We also know that `(x,y) in (C xx D)` which is equivalent to `x in C` and `y in D`
