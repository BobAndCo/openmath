					<p>
						We'll show that `O/` and `Y` are elements of `cc T_(nn Y)`, this can be seen as since `O/ in cc T`, then `Y nn O/ = O/ in cc T_(nn Y)` and also since `Y sube X`, <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-a-set-intersected-with-a-superset-is-itself">then</span> `Y nn X = Y` so `Y in cc T _ (nn Y)` 
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we want to prove that `cc T _(nn Y)` is closed under abitrary unions, which we know <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-intersection-factors-from-intersection">because</span> `bigcup_(alpha in I) (U_alpha nn Y) = (bigcup_(alpha in I) U_alpha) nn Y`. Similarly we can see that it's closed under finite intersections <span class="knowledge-link" data-href="/fundamentals/sets.html#proposition-intersection-factors-from-intersection">as</span> `(U_1 nn Y) nn ... nn (U_n nn Y) = (U_1 nn ... nn U_n) nn Y`.

					<p>
						Therefore we know that `cc T_(nn Y)` is a topology.

					<p>
						First note that given any element `Y nn B in M`, we know that it is open with respect to `cc T_(nn Y)`, because `B` is open with respect to `X`

						Now let `Y nn U` be an open set of `Y` which means that `U` is open in `X`. Let `p in Y nn U` , since `p in U` , `U` is open in `X` and `cc B` is a basis for `X` then we know there is some
