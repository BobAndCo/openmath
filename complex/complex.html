                </p>
                <p>
                    If `fr I(z) >= fr I(z_Omega)`, then clearly `fr I(z) > 1`, on the other hand if `fr I(z) < fr I(z_Omega)` we have more work to do. So assume `fr I(z) < fr I(z_Omega)`.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to the fact that `z` resides in a ball with radius `fr I(z_Omega) - 1` we can see that `fr I(z_Omega) - 1 gt abs(z - z_Omega) = abs(z_Omega - z)` <a href="#proposition-modulus-is-greater-than-it's-components">`ge`</a> `abs(fr I(z_Omega - z)) `<a href="#proposition-imaginary-part-distributes">`=`</a>`abs(fr I(z_Omega) - fr I(z))` and since `fr I : CC to RR` and that `fr I(z) < fr I(z_Omega)` we know that `fr I(z_Omega) - fr I(z) gt 0` and thus `abs(fr I(z_Omega) - fr I(z)) `<a href="../analysis/single_variable.html#definition-absolute-value">`=`</a>`fr I(z_Omega) - fr I(z)`.

                    By collapsing our inequalities we have that `fr I(z_Omega) - 1 gt fr I(z_Omega) - fr I(z)` thus subtracting `fr I(z_Omega)` from both sides and then multiplying by `-1` yields `1 lt fr I(z)` thus `z in Omega` as needed.

                    first of all, there is no theorem which says the image of an open set is open <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1279640/571643">counter example</a>, thus we must actually compute the image which isn't too hard.

                    suppose that `z in S` and now consider `e^z`, `z = x + iy` where `x in RR` and `y in (-pi/2, pi/2)`, therefore `e^z = e^x * e^(iy)`, thus the image equals the right hand side of the plane excluding the `y` axis (TODO: details), which is open because (TODO)

But from our first paragraph we know that `abs(f(a)) le abs(a)`, which implies that `abs(f(a)) = abs(a)`, thus by the second part of the schwarz lemma then we get some constant `c` with `abs(c) = 1` with `f(z) = cz` for all `z` on the unit disk, then we can take `lambda = c`

                <p>

If `n > 0`, then `f(c) = f'(c) = f''(c) = ... = f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0` but `f^{(n)}(c) != 0` and we say that `f` has a zero of order `n` at `c`. From algebra we know that a polynomial has a zero at `c` iff `z - c` is a factor of that polynomial. The zero has order of multiplicity `n` if the factor `z - c` occurs exactly `n` times. Consideration of the Taylor series shows that an analytic function has a zero at `c` iff `z - c` is a factor of that function and the multiplicity is defined in the same way. For `z` in `D(c, r)`, then since the first `n - 1` terms wer zeros then the power series becomes

The power series in the square brackets converges in `D(c, r)` to an analytic function `phi(z)` TODO: why? with `phi(c) = a_n = f^{(n)}(c)/(n!) != 0`. Thus `f` has a zeor of order `n` at `c` iff `f(z)` can be factored in a neightborhood of `c` as `f(z) = (z - c)^n phi(z)` where `phi` is analytic in a neighborhood of `c` and `phi(c) != 0`.

            We first want to show that f is `n` times differentiable at 0, to be n times differentiable at 0, we need to
            show that the limit `lim_{h -> 0} f^{(n-1)}(h)/h` exists, since the function is piecewise at zero, we'll
            want to show that the right and left limit are both equal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider when `x > 0`, in this situation we know that the function is defined as `e^{(-1)/x^2}`, and let's
            try to come
            up with a generic n-th derivative.
        </p>

        <p>
            taking a look at the first derivative get `f(x) * {-1 * -2}/x^3 = f(x) * 2/x^3`, then taking the derivative again and using the product rule we get `f(x) * 2/x^3 + f(x) * {-6}/x^4 = f(x) * (2/x^3 + {-6}/x^4)`, we can observe that by usign the product rule, and the fact that `e^(k(x))` likes to stay around that `f^(n)(x) = e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i` where `a_i in bb R` where `a_1 = a_2 = 0` and `a_k = (k-1)! * (-1)^k` for `k >= 3`.  Note that I haven't actually proven this fact, but it follows naturally by induction with the chain and product rule, I will save induction for the second half.
        </p>

        <p>
            for `x <= 0` then we know that all derivatives are equal to zero, since taking the derivative of any
                constant becomes zero 
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose `n = 1` let's first check the first derivative at 0, from the left, we can see that `lim_{x->0^-} {f(x) - f(0)}/{x - 0} = lim_{x->0^-} {0 - 0} / x = 0` from the right, we're computing `lim_{x-> 0^+} {(1/e)^(1/x^2)}/{x}` considering `t = 1/x`, then we can rewrite the limit as `lim_{t -> oo^+} t * (1/e)^{t^2} = lim_{t -> oo^+} t/e^{t^2}`, since it's in an indeterminate form, we may use l'hopitals rule which gives us `lim_{t -> oo^+} 1/{2t* e^{t^2}} = 0` thus we've shown it's differentiable here and it's derviative is 0.
        </p>

        <p>
            let `n in bb N` and assume that the above is true for `n`, that is that `f^{(n)}(x)` is differentiable at 0 and that it's derivative is 0, now let's show it's true for `n + 1`, we need to check the n-th  `lim_{x-> 0^+} {f^{(n)}(x) - f^{(n)}(0)}/{x}` by the induction hypothesis we already know that `f^{(n)}(0) = 0` so our limit is just `lim_{x-> 0^+} {f^{(n)}(x)}/{x}` which is equal to `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i}/{x}`.
        </p>

        <p>
            To show  `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i}/{x} = 0` it suffices to show that for any `l in {1, ..., 3n}` that `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = 0` as we can use summation rules for limits. We should also note that `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = lim_{x-> 0^+} {(a_l)/x^(l + 1)}/{e^{1/x^2}}` which is equivalent to `lim_{x-> +oo} {(a_l)* x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}} = (a_l)* lim_{x-> +oo} {x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}}`.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since for `x >= 1` we have `e^(x^2) >= e^x` then by first year calculus we know `lim_{x -> +oo} {e^x}/{x^k} = +oo` it would imply that also `lim_{x -> +oo} {e^(x^2)}/{x^k} = +oo` and that `lim_{x -> 0} {x^k}/{e^{x^2}} = 0`, therefore `(a_l)* lim_{x-> +oo} {x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}} = 0` and thus the right and left side limits match, so the function is n-times differentiable at 0 with it's derviative actually equalling 0.

            Since all derivatives of `f(x)` are zero at `0` then `f(x)` is identically 0 on some disk around `0`, that's assuming that there is an expansion for `f(x)` near the origin, since clearly the function is not constant around the origin, then there cannot be an expansion for `f(x)` around the origin.

            this exercise shows us that that analytic functions are `C^oo(RR)` but that `C^oo(RR)` functions are certainly might not be analytic, also in `CC` we know that if you're once differentiable then you're analytic which is much stronger than in `RR`

        <h1>question 2</h1>

        <p>suppose `f` is analytic on `A` with an isolated singularity at `z_0` and that `z_0` is a removable singularity</p>

        <p>
            `=> (1)`, since `z_0` is a removable singularity, then all of the `b_k`'s are zero, then we know that `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n` is an analytic and continuous function `g` on `A uu {z_0}` and also any neighborhood of `z_0`, since the image of a compact set through a continuous function is bounded, we can see that `f` is bounded
        </p>

        <p>
            `=> (2)` the limit should exist since `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n` thus as `z -> z_0` then the limit tends to `a_0 in CC`
        </p>

        <p>
            `=> (3)` since the previous limit exists and we know that `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0) = 0` then the product is also zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            (`lArr`) To show equivalence we need to prove each of the opposite directions, we can see that if b were true, it would imply c to be true, and if a were true then c would also be true because the limit would be bounded above by `M * |z - z_0|` which goes to 0, therefore we only have to prove that `(c) => z_0` is a removable singularity, that is to say each `b_k` is zero in the laurent expansion around `z_0`.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the definition of the laurent expansion we know that each coefficient `b_k = 1/(2 pi i) int_{gamma_r} f(zeta)(zeta - z_0)^(k - 1) d zeta` where `gamma_r` is a circle in `A` whose interior lies in A. Since we've assumed c to be true and using the epsilon delta definition of limit, we can see that by letting `epsilon > 0`, there is some `0 < r < 1` where for any point `x in gamma_r`, we know that `|f(x) * (x - z_0)| < epsilon <=> |f(x)| < epsilon / |x - z_0| = epsilon / r`, thus `|b_k| <= 1/(2 pi) int_{gamma_r} |f(zeta)||zeta - z_0|^(k - 1) |d zeta| <= 1/2pi * epsilon / r * r^{k - 1} int_{gamma_r} |d zeta| = 1 / (2 pi) * epsilon / r * r^{k - 1} 2 pi r = epsilon * r^{k - 1} <= epsilon` (since `0 < r < 1`) that is to say that `b_k = 0`

        <p>
            (`=>`) Assume that `z_0` is a simple pole, that is to say that `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n + b_1 / (z - z_0)` with `b_1 != 0`, then `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0) f(z) = lim_{z -> z_0} b_1 + (z - z_0) *  sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n = b_1 != 0` as needed
        </p>   

        <p>
            (`lArr`) Assume that `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0) f(z)` exists and is non-zero, we'll take a moment to introduce corollary of question 2 which I found in the book (which can be obtained by subbing in `f(z) * (z - z_0)^k` into question 2 in place of `f(z)`)
        </p>

        <div class="corollary">

                `z_0` is a pole of order `<= n` (or possibly removable singularity) iff `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0)^(n + 1) f(z) = 0`
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            from our initial assumption we can see that `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0)^2 f(z) = 0` by the above corollary we know that this means `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^n + b_1/ (z - z_0)` for some constant `b_1` which may or may not be zero. Either way it implies that `(z - z_0) f(z) = (z - z_0) (sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n) + b_1` thus the limit of `(z - z_0) f(z)` as `z -> z_0` is equal to `b_1`, but by assumption it must not be zero, which implies that `f` has a simple pole at `z_0`
        </p>

        <h3>2</h3>

        <p>
            `z_0` is a pole of order `k >= 1` is by definition: `f(z) = b_k / (z - z_0)^k + b_(k - 1)/ (z - z_0)^(k - 1) + ... + b_1 / (z - z_0) + sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^n = 1/(z - z_0)^k * [b_k + b_(k - 1) (z - z_0) + ... + b_1 ( z - z_0)^(k - 1) + sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^(n + k)]` (valid in a deleted neighborhood of `z_0` and `b_k` non-zero), then let `phi(z)` be equal to the entire expression contained in the square braces, which we can see is analytic in the neighborhood with `z_0` re-inserted as it is a convergent power series and when evaluated at `z_0` is non-zero. Note that all of these steps are bi-implications, meaning that we can traverse the proof in reverse order to acheive the other direction, as needed.

            In the book it says the following on higher order poles:

        <img src="images/higher_order_poles.png" alt="">

        <p>
            therefore I will focus on the formula given by proposition 4.1.6, the general formula is as above, and the main concepts behind this proof are to use part 2 of question 3 to rewrite `phi(z)` as the inner part of the square brackets which yields `f(z) = b_k / (z - z_0)^k + b_(k - 1) / (z - z_0)^(k - 1) + ... + b_1 / (z - z_0) + a_0 + a_1(z - z_0) + ...`, then use contradiction to see `b_k` is non-zero thus we have a pole of order `k`, the last idea is to differentiate `k` times to obtain a closed formula.

                        `0 = int_Gamma f(z) dz = int_{-R to -epsilon} f(z) dz + int_{R to epsilon} f(z) dz + int_{gamma_epsilon} f(z) dz + int_{gamma_R} f(z) dz`

                       along the exterior path `z = R e^(it) = R cos(t) + i R sin(t)`, the integrand's numerator is `1 - e^(iz) = 1 - e^(-R sin(t) + i R cos(t))` since `t in [0, pi]` then we know that `sin` stays within `[0, 1]` and `R > 0` so `e^(-R sin(t)) le 1`, thus we can say that `abs(1 - e^(iz)) le 2` to conclude that 
                       <div class="centered-content">
                        `abs((1 - e^(iz))/z^2) le 2 / abs(z)^2`

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        As `R to oo` in the above, then clearly the above expresion becomes 0, this bound allows us to use the <a href="#estimation-lemma">estimation lemma</a> which shows that `int_{gamma_R} f(z) dz = 0`
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We can show that `f(z) + iz/z^2` is bounded expanding the taylor series and comparing by using a geometric series, by knowing that it's bounded it means that in the limit there won't be any contribution to the path integral, which is due to the fact that arc length approaches zero.

                    <li>
                        `int_0^pi (1 - e^(i(epsilon * e^(i theta))))/(epsilon e^(i theta))^2 i (epsilon e^(i theta)) d theta = i int_0^pi (1 - e^(i epsilon e^(i theta)))/(epsilon e^(i theta)) d theta =i int_0^pi (1 - sum_{k = 0}^oo (i^k (epsilon e^(i theta))^k)/(k!))/(epsilon e^(i theta)) d theta = -i int_0^pi (sum_{k = 1}^oo (i^k (epsilon e^(i theta))^k)/(k!))/(epsilon e^(i theta)) d theta = -i int_0^pi sum_{k = 1}^oo (i^k (epsilon e^(i theta))^(k - 1))/(k!) d theta`
                        <p>
                            Note that as `epsilon to 0` the inner summation simply becomes `i` and thus: 
                        </p>
                        `-i int_0^pi i d theta = int_0^pi d theta = pi`, therefore the correctly oriented integral is `-pi`
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            By `3` and `5` we can conclude that `pi = int_-oo^oo f(x) dx = int_-oo^oo (1 - cos(x)) / x^2 - (i sin(x))/x^2 dx = int_-oo^oo (1- cos(x))/x^2 - i int_-oo^oo (sin(x)/ x^2) dx `
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thus by taking the real parts of both sides we can see that `pi = int_-oo^oo (1 - cos(x))/x^2`

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since our function `(1 - cos(x))/x^2` is a composition of even functions, it is even as well, and thus `int_0^oo f(z) dz = pi/2`

                    Consider the extension of the integrand to a function `g(z) = 1/(z^2 + 1)^2` which makes things at least a little better as `(z^2 + 1)^2 = (z + i)^2 (z - i)^2`, which tells us we have poles at `z = pm i`.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we consider the semicircle of radius `R` in the upper two quadrants, so long as `R > 1` `i` will be contained within the semicircle, note that `-i` will never be contained within it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore using the residue theorem we can see that `int_(S_R) f(z) dz = int_-R^R f(x) dx + int_(C_R) f(z) dz = 2pi i * text(res)(g, i)`
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the upper cap `C_R` we note that `abs(f(z)) = 1/(z^2 + 1)^2` and that by the reciprocal of the reverse triangle equality we have for any `a, b in CC, 1/abs(a - b) le 1/abs(abs(a) - abs(b))` so that `abs(1/(z^2 + 1)^2) = 1/abs((z^2 + 1))^2 le 1/abs(abs(z^2) + abs(1))^2 = 1/(R^2 + 1)^2` thus by the estimation lemma, we see that `abs(int_-oo^oo f(x) dx) le 1/(R^2 + 1)^2 * R pi` since `R to oo` then this integral is zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore from the residue theorem we can see that `lim_{R to oo} int_-R^R f(x) dx = 2pi i * text(res)(g, i)` now all we have to figure out is the value of `text(res)(g, i)`
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this pole is of order two, we can invoke the residue formula for higher order poles
                    <div class="centered-content">
                        `text(res)(1/(1+x^2)^2, i) =   d/dz [(z - i)^2 * 1 / ((z + i)^2 * (z - 1)^2)] = d/dz [1/(z + i)^2] = -2/(z + i)^3`
