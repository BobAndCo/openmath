                suppose `f: Omega -> CC` is analytic on an open set `omega in CC` and that `c in Omega`. We know taht the taylor series for `f(z)` centered at `c` converges to `f(z)` at least in the largest open disk `D(c, r)` centered at `c` and contained in `Omega`. Therefore we have:
                <p>
                    `f(z) = sum_{k = 0}^{oo} f^{(k)}(c) / (k!) (z - c)^k`

                for `|z - c| < r`. 
                
                <ul>
                    <li>If `f^{(k)}(c) = 0` for all `k`, then `f(z)` is identically `0` in `D(c, r)`</li>
                    <li>
                        If not, then there is a smallest non-negative integer `n` holding `f^{(n)}(c) != 0`. If `n = 0`, then `f(c) !=0`. If `n > 0`, then `f(c) = f'(c) = f''(c) = ... = f^{(n - 1)}(c) = 0` but `f^{(n)}(c) != 0` and we say that `f` has a zero of order `n` at `c`. From algebra we know that a polynomial has a zero at `c` iff `z - c` is a factor of that polynomial. The zero has order of multiplicity `n` if the factor `z - c` occurs exactly `n` times. Consideration of the Taylor series shows that an analytic function has a zero at `c` iff `z - c` is a factor of that function and the multiplicity is defined in the same way. For `z` in `D(c, r)`, then since the first `n - 1` terms wer zeros then the power series becomes
                        <p>
                            `f(z) = a_n* (z - c)^n + a_(n + 1) (z - c)^(n + 1) + + a_(n + 2) (z - c)^(n + 2) + ... = (z - c)^n * [a_n + a_(n + 1) * (z - c) + a_(n + 2) * (z - c)^2 + ...]`

                        where `a_k = f^{(k)}(c)/(k!)`. The power series in the square brackets converges in `D(c, r)` to an analytic function `phi(z)` TODO: why? with `phi(c) = a_n = f^{(n)}(c)/(n!) != 0`. Thus `f` has a zeor of order `n` at `c` iff `f(z)` can be factored in a neightborhood of `c` as `f(z) = (z - c)^n phi(z)` where `phi` is analytic in a neighborhood of `c` and `phi(c) != 0`.

                looking at the factorization in the last theorem, we can see that `phi(z)` is analytic and so is continuous on `D(c, r)`, since `phi(c) != 0`, there is a radius `p` with `0 < p < r` such that `phi(z)` is never 0 for `|z - c| < p`. Since `f(z) = (z - c)^n phi(z)` for all `z in D(c, p)` we conclude that `f` has no zeros other than `c` in that disk, in this sense the zeros of `f` are isolated.

            We first want to show that f is `n` times differentiable at 0, to be n times differentiable at 0, we need to
            show that the limit `lim_{h -> 0} f^{(n-1)}(h)/h` exists, since the function is piecewise at zero, we'll
            want to show that the right and left limit are both equal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider when `x > 0`, in this situation we know that the function is defined as `e^{(-1)/x^2}`, and let's
            try to come
            up with a generic n-th derivative.
        </p>

        <p>
            taking a look at the first derivative get `f(x) * {-1 * -2}/x^3 = f(x) * 2/x^3`, then taking the derivative again and using the product rule we get `f(x) * 2/x^3 + f(x) * {-6}/x^4 = f(x) * (2/x^3 + {-6}/x^4)`, we can observe that by usign the product rule, and the fact that `e^(k(x))` likes to stay around that `f^(n)(x) = e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i` where `a_i in bb R` where `a_1 = a_2 = 0` and `a_k = (k-1)! * (-1)^k` for `k >= 3`.  Note that I haven't actually proven this fact, but it follows naturally by induction with the chain and product rule, I will save induction for the second half.
        </p>

        <p>
            for `x <= 0` then we know that all derivatives are equal to zero, since taking the derivative of any
                constant becomes zero 
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose `n = 1` let's first check the first derivative at 0, from the left, we can see that `lim_{x->0^-} {f(x) - f(0)}/{x - 0} = lim_{x->0^-} {0 - 0} / x = 0` from the right, we're computing `lim_{x-> 0^+} {(1/e)^(1/x^2)}/{x}` considering `t = 1/x`, then we can rewrite the limit as `lim_{t -> oo^+} t * (1/e)^{t^2} = lim_{t -> oo^+} t/e^{t^2}`, since it's in an indeterminate form, we may use l'hopitals rule which gives us `lim_{t -> oo^+} 1/{2t* e^{t^2}} = 0` thus we've shown it's differentiable here and it's derviative is 0.
        </p>

        <p>
            let `n in bb N` and assume that the above is true for `n`, that is that `f^{(n)}(x)` is differentiable at 0 and that it's derivative is 0, now let's show it's true for `n + 1`, we need to check the n-th  `lim_{x-> 0^+} {f^{(n)}(x) - f^{(n)}(0)}/{x}` by the induction hypothesis we already know that `f^{(n)}(0) = 0` so our limit is just `lim_{x-> 0^+} {f^{(n)}(x)}/{x}` which is equal to `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i}/{x}`.
        </p>

        <p>
            To show  `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * sum_{i = 1}^{3 * n} (a_i)/x^i}/{x} = 0` it suffices to show that for any `l in {1, ..., 3n}` that `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = 0` as we can use summation rules for limits. We should also note that `lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = lim_{x-> 0^+} {e^{(-1)/x^2} * (a_l)/x^l}/{x} = lim_{x-> 0^+} {(a_l)/x^(l + 1)}/{e^{1/x^2}}` which is equivalent to `lim_{x-> +oo} {(a_l)* x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}} = (a_l)* lim_{x-> +oo} {x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}}`.
        </p>

        <p>
            Since for `x >= 1` we have `e^(x^2) >= e^x` then by first year calculus we know `lim_{x -> +oo} {e^x}/{x^k} = +oo` it would imply that also `lim_{x -> +oo} {e^(x^2)}/{x^k} = +oo` and that `lim_{x -> 0} {x^k}/{e^{x^2}} = 0`, therefore `(a_l)* lim_{x-> +oo} {x^(l + 1)}/{e^{x^2}} = 0` and thus the right and left side limits match, so the function is n-times differentiable at 0 with it's derviative actually equalling 0.
        </p>

            Since all derivatives of `f(x)` are zero at `0` then `f(x)` is identically 0 on some disk around `0`, that's assuming that there is an expansion for `f(x)` near the origin, since clearly the function is not constant around the origin, then there cannot be an expansion for `f(x)` around the origin.

            this exercise shows us that that analytic functions are `C^oo(RR)` but that `C^oo(RR)` functions are certainly might not be analytic, also in `CC` we know that if you're once differentiable then you're analytic which is much stronger than in `RR`

        <h1>question 2</h1>

        <p>suppose `f` is analytic on `A` with an isolated singularity at `z_0` and that `z_0` is a removable singularity</p>

        <p>
            `=> (1)`, since `z_0` is a removable singularity, then all of the `b_k`'s are zero, then we know that `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n` is an analytic and continuous function `g` on `A uu {z_0}` and also any neighborhood of `z_0`, since the image of a compact set through a continuous function is bounded, we can see that `f` is bounded
        </p>

        <p>
            `=> (2)` the limit should exist since `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^{oo} a_n (z - z_0)^n` thus as `z -> z_0` then the limit tends to `a_0 in CC`
        </p>

        <p>
            `=> (3)` since the previous limit exists and we know that `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0) = 0` then the product is also zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            (`lArr`) To show equivalence we need to prove each of the opposite directions, we can see that if b were true, it would imply c to be true, and if a were true then c would also be true because the limit would be bounded above by `M * |z - z_0|` which goes to 0, therefore we only have to prove that `(c) => z_0` is a removable singularity, that is to say each `b_k` is zero in the laurent expansion around `z_0`.
        </p>

        <p>
            By the definition of the laurent expansion we know that each coefficient `b_k = 1/(2 pi i) int_{gamma_r} f(zeta)(zeta - z_0)^(k - 1) d zeta` where `gamma_r` is a circle in `A` whose interior lies in A. Since we've assumed c to be true and using the epsilon delta definition of limit, we can see that by letting `epsilon > 0`, there is some `0 < r < 1` where for any point `x in gamma_r`, we know that `|f(x) * (x - z_0)| < epsilon <=> |f(x)| < epsilon / |x - z_0| = epsilon / r`, thus `|b_k| <= 1/(2 pi) int_{gamma_r} |f(zeta)||zeta - z_0|^(k - 1) |d zeta| <= 1/2pi * epsilon / r * r^{k - 1} int_{gamma_r} |d zeta| = 1 / (2 pi) * epsilon / r * r^{k - 1} 2 pi r = epsilon * r^{k - 1} <= epsilon` (since `0 < r < 1`) that is to say that `b_k = 0`

        <p>
            from our initial assumption we can see that `lim_{z -> z_0} (z - z_0)^2 f(z) = 0` by the above corollary we know that this means `f(z) = sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^n + b_1/ (z - z_0)` for some constant `b_1` which may or may not be zero. Either way it implies that `(z - z_0) f(z) = (z - z_0) (sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n) + b_1` thus the limit of `(z - z_0) f(z)` as `z -> z_0` is equal to `b_1`, but by assumption it must not be zero, which implies that `f` has a simple pole at `z_0`

            `z_0` is a pole of order `k >= 1` is by definition: `f(z) = b_k / (z - z_0)^k + b_(k - 1)/ (z - z_0)^(k - 1) + ... + b_1 / (z - z_0) + sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^n = 1/(z - z_0)^k * [b_k + b_(k - 1) (z - z_0) + ... + b_1 ( z - z_0)^(k - 1) + sum_{n = 0}^oo a_n (z - z_0)^(n + k)]` (valid in a deleted neighborhood of `z_0` and `b_k` non-zero), then let `phi(z)` be equal to the entire expression contained in the square braces, which we can see is analytic in the neighborhood with `z_0` re-inserted as it is a convergent power series and when evaluated at `z_0` is non-zero. Note that all of these steps are bi-implications, meaning that we can traverse the proof in reverse order to acheive the other direction, as needed.

            therefore I will focus on the formula given by proposition 4.1.6, the general formula is as above, and the main concepts behind this proof are to use part 2 of question 3 to rewrite `phi(z)` as the inner part of the square brackets which yields `f(z) = b_k / (z - z_0)^k + b_(k - 1) / (z - z_0)^(k - 1) + ... + b_1 / (z - z_0) + a_0 + a_1(z - z_0) + ...`, then use contradiction to see `b_k` is non-zero thus we have a pole of order `k`, the last idea is to differentiate `k` times to obtain a closed formula.
